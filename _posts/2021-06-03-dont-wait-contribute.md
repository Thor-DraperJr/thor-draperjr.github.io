There are two types of people—those who find problems and those who bring solutions.

## Introduction

Upset about missing out on a promotion? Frustrated about not being asked to work on a project? Then, isolate your problem and do something about it.

Here’s the agenda:

* Ask.
* Start making a difference today.
* Communication is a two-way street.

### Ask

Asking for a job, a role or a recommendation can be a daunting task. Yet, expressing your desire to take on new challenges is becoming a required skill in a virtual world. Over the past few months, I’ve suggested reaching out to mentors, setting up virtual coffees, but I don’t think I’ve hammered home the fact that you *need* to ask for an opportunity.

Start small. Utilize the endorsement and recommendations features here on LinkedIn. Ask your peers for support. Endorsements take a single click, and recommendations don’t have a word limit.

There aren’t obvious cues that will make you feel comfortable asking for help. Repetition is going to make you more comfortable. Start asking for support.

### Start making a difference today

Waiting for a job title is the lazy approach to leadership. If you are inside an organization and feel like you are being passed up for promotions or roles; I’ve seen two common reasons.

**Problem 1 -  Capability:** Your manager may not feel that you are capable of doing the task. The most common question I hear is, “how can I possibly get experience if I need experience in a role to perform that role.”

Great job. You’ve found the problem.

The solution is awareness. I haven’t heard of a situation where a person expressed their desire, volunteered time in a similar domain outside of work, or produced in-line content toward the position.

**Problem 2 - Necessity:** You’re not needed for the position, or your manager might feel you are needed at your current position. You could be doing something that nobody else wants to do, or you could be doing something that nobody else can do (or possibly they can’t do it as well).

This is a bit more challenging.

The solution is to stretch. Stretch your time. Ask for opportunities to job shadow. Create connections and contribute where you can.

If you are getting the sense that those around you want to maintain the status quo. You need to shake up your environment. It doesn’t mean quit your job, but you might have to get involved with outside organizations and skill up on your own time...and then quit your job.

### Communication is a two-way street

Set a standard. Adhere to your standard. I’ve never seen someone complain about an over communicator. Be timely in your responses and bring value to the conversation.

Take feedback well. It’s not enough to receive input. If you don’t see actionable items on a review, it is up to you to ask for clarification. If you’re not suitable for a position, ask for more information and what might make you ready.

Provide solutions. Suppose you’ve identified a gap in material or had an idea of how to improve something. Do it. I’ve been in the training space for a long time. My opportunity to train professionally came the moment my mentality changed. I stopped complaining about the material and saying things like “I would do it differently if I were teaching”. Instead, I started marking writing up lesson plans to bridge the gap.

Bring your perspective and become a great collaborator.

Getting ahead is tough. You need to take action and differentiate yourself from the pack. Don’t wait to contribute.
