As someone who works a full-time job at Microsoft, teaches part-time, and is also working on obtaining multiple certifications through the SANS Institute, I understand the importance of balancing work, education, and personal life. To help manage my time and stay organized, I've adopted the time blocking technique.

## What is Time Blocking?

Time blocking is a scheduling method where you allocate specific blocks of time for different tasks and activities. It helps you prioritize tasks, reduce distractions, and maximize productivity.

## My Example Schedule

Here's an example of my weekly schedule, which incorporates time blocking:

6:00 AM - 7:00 AM: Wake up, shower, and breakfast

7:00 AM - 4:00 PM: Work at Microsoft

4:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Exercise or run

5:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Study for SANS certification

6:00 PM - 7:00 PM: Dinner and downtime

7:00 PM - 10:00 PM: Teach part-time

10:00 PM - 11:00 PM: Study for SANS certification or work on a personal project

11:00 PM - 12:00 AM: Wind down and prepare for bed

## Advantages of Time Blocking

- Helps you stay organized and focused on specific tasks
- Prioritizes tasks based on their importance
- Minimizes distractions and maximizes productivity
- Allows you to allocate dedicated time for self-care and downtime

Of course, this is just my example schedule, and everyone's schedule will look different based on their individual needs and responsibilities. The key is to find a time blocking system that works for you and stick to it. This will help you stay organized and focused, allowing you to achieve your goals and find a healthy balance between work, education, and personal life.
