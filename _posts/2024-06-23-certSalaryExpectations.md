One of the questions I've often heard is, "Once I get my X certification, what should my salary expectations be?"

I believe that certifications offer two primary benefits. First, in a world filled with imposter syndrome, obtaining a cert can reassure you that you indeed possess at least some knowledge covered by these specific objectives. Second, during an interview, it's always beneficial to share recent anecdotes that demonstrate a growth mindset.

The follow-up question is usually, "What should my next certification be?" Interestingly, I often respond that to find the answer to this question, you'll need to ensure you have mentors in your network who are in the role you aspire to pursue.

While obtaining certifications might improve your chances of landing an interview, I haven't observed them to be a significant factor in salary negotiations.
