## My Unconventional Journey

- Army National Guard (E-4 Infantryman): mastering grit and teamwork  
- Branch Manager at Enterprise Rent-A-Car’s largest non-airport location: delivering top-tier customer experiences  
- Mid-Market Consultant at Paychex: solving payroll puzzles for small businesses  
- Founder & Owner of Stay Fit LLC in Charlotte (2020): built and sold my own gym to an escape-room operator  
- Cybersecurity Bootcamp Instructor (2020–2024): guided career-changers through hands-on labs and cert prep  
- Senior Security Solutions Engineer at Microsoft (Apr 2024–present): advising U.S. payors, providers & life-sciences on Sentinel, XDR & Azure security  

Each chapter taught me that true security starts by understanding real human needs.

- Experimenting with AI tools to automate routine tasks and free up headspace  
- Crafting pun-fueled icebreakers to keep security conversations human
