## Is Thor your real name?

What up! My name *is* Thor Draper Jr. I currently work as a Sr. Security Technical Specialist at Microsoft. In addition, I am a cybersecurity instructor at 2U education. One big thing of note is that I'm a career changer.

### Professional Background

I didn't begin my IT journey until the second half of 2019. My first career was all over the place, from sales, management, entrepreneurship, and the military. I had the opportunity to purchase a gym in my hometown. While running my business, I began to explore my next career move and discovered a passion for the IT industry. I took the CompTIA ITF+ in June and was hooked. My father had been in cybersecurity for years and I found that I shared his interest in the field. I was able to earn my associate's degree in Cloud and Virtualization in July 2021 and earned my bachelor's degree from SANS in applied cybersecurity in early 2024. I completed both of these primarily through certifications. You can view my full list of certifications on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thor-draperjr/).
